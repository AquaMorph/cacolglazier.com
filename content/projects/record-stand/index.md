I wanted a simplistic record display stand to safely hold albums while I played my records. I looked and was unable to find anything that met my requirements so I designed my own. I wanted one that fully supported the album artwork without relying on pinching the bottom. Minimizing the amount of materials used while 3D printing was also a design priority. 30% infill is what I used for this print but probably even less can be used because, even with several records, the total amount of weight that is to be supported is minimal. Most of the weight is transfered to the bottom of the stand.
