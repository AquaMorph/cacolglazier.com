# Part List

**Note:** One might be able to purchase the required screws from the local hardware store for less since they can be purchased without an entire set of screws. These screws are standard screws so it also might be helpful to have them for other projects including other parts of the AquaMOCO system.

2. Place the large gear on the base's shaft.
3. Push the small gear on the stepper motor shaft and align with the larger gear. This might require a hammer.
