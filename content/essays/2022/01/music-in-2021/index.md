In 2021 I averaged listening to 44 songs a day for a grand total of 16,085 which is down from my last year total of 19,681. I spent even more time this year listening to podcasts and audiobooks over music.

# Favorite Albums of 2021

## 10. Faith in Persona 

{{< spotify "spotify:album:1HBuWe94Z8qMTj2IvgfO4B" >}}

Vaporwave isn't dead yet.

## 9. The Ballad of Dood & Juanita

{{< spotify "spotify:album:5CigVuEyiAYaNYx2M2w4hh" >}}

Another solid album from Sturgill Simpson. Leaning more into bluegrass and also another concept album. My least favorite album of his but that's a pretty high bar.

## 8. star-crossed

{{< spotify "spotify:album:6y9LbrjY2TpaLvtbE7FTkc" >}}

I was not a big fan of this album on first listen but that was my fault because it was a different album from my expectations. Second listen I came around to it musically. The lyrics in this album are excellent and some of Kacey Musgraves' best songwriting.

## 7. SINNER GET READY

{{< spotify "spotify:album:06wtf2TCkmyTgS1yZGiSr5" >}}

Lingua Ignota adds folk to the mix of her combination of classical and industrial music and I love it.

## 6. Flux

{{< spotify "spotify:album:0uNIaCQrRPUMkdnev3zMRt" >}}

I think this combines both the pop and metal influences Poppy has been doing over the years into cohesive album.

## 5. DEMIDEVIL

{{< spotify "spotify:album:438ToDoVaJH5aTIXXrlDyI" >}}

This album is as stupid as it is fun but there is nothing wrong with that.

## 4. My Bluegrass Heart

{{< spotify "spotify:album:2mi6ZJQlD25OEzmZOTL7hR" >}}

Best bluegrass album of the year featuring some of the best instrumentalists alive.

## 3. Death Trap

{{< spotify "spotify:album:44ttjPuP1sHIo275qYkEGC" >}}

This is one of my favorite synthwave albums of all time. The production value is extremely high and mixes a bunch of different subgeneres of synthwave in a tied together manner. On top of all that it is a solid concept album that tells a story that fits perfectly with the mood the music produces.

## 2. Flow State

{{< spotify "spotify:album:6MoGP1TIQELKPX53klJusi" >}}

I clicked so much will this album. It's such a great album to put on and get things done.

## 1. Mercurial World

{{< spotify "spotify:album:1ERrUvG31thFCxdwWUoJrY" >}}

I mean who does not like this album? I was extremely hyped for it and it lived up to it. Every single song on the album is solid and it ends on the highest note for the entire album. Oh plus it works listening in reverse order as well to mix things up.
