In 2019 I averaged listening to 57 songs a day for a grand total of 21,161 which is up from my last year total of 20,223. My music tastes continued to be largely dominated by country and folk music.

# Favorite Albums of 2019

## 10. All My Heroes Are Cornballs

{{< spotify "spotify:album:5ilsl5R2lGACTnPZMKIp7o" >}}

This is my favorite rap album of the year. It's explosive and chaotic. This album is a bit messy but it's a fun mess.

## 9. Watchmen

{{< spotify "spotify:album:3TB6SKSLA7zUN1jIKwO31e" >}}

The score for HBO's Watchmen is fantastic up there with some of the best stuff Nine Inch Nails have done.

## 8. Trust In The Lifeforce of The Deep Mystery

{{< spotify "spotify:album:2mvz0NPBCPTbSEgRViuDLK" >}}

An impressive fusion of electronic music and jazz. There is a track featuring Kate Tempest which is a great combination.

## 7. Between the Country

{{< spotify "spotify:album:3I8X5k9o3KJHtxhQRWOQaf" >}}

Between the Country is a solid folk album that sounds timeless. If you told me it was a 70s outlaw album I would believe you. 

## 6. Pony

{{< spotify "spotify:album:7Jn1h8E5aT96pdyrPxrLWi" >}}

Orville Peck reminds me of a modern Elvis Presley with a similar sounding voice and a slight blues influence. Slightly more country though yeehaw.

## 5. CALIGULA

{{< spotify "spotify:album:2GBJg7nTQs3go1w24ECKvy" >}}

This album is what happens when you combine classical music with industrial music. The vocals are haunting and everything blends together in a way where the different styles compliment each other.

## 4. Country Squire

{{< spotify "spotify:album:2T9P5dSm786uuxA5tkI1Xb" >}}

This is my favorite country album of the year even though there were several good ones. Sturgill Simpson produced this album and Tyler Childers vocals and lyrics are wonderful.

## 3. 1000 gecs

## 2. Norman Fucking Rockwell!

{{< spotify "spotify:album:5XpEKORZ4y6OrCZSKsi46A" >}}

I've been a long time fan of Lana Del Rey but this is by far her best album. Jack Antonoff production work at its best and all the good parts of Lana condensed into a single album.

## 1. Sound & Fury

{{< spotify "spotify:album:2ITJBRqMwZ0luWBnnZQ4Hq" >}}

Psychedelic rock is back and I love it. Every track in this album kicks. This album is a major departure for Sturgill Simpson whose three previous albums are pure country albums. It took me a few listens to get used to the heavily distorted vocals but after adjusting to the surprise, the vocals mix in perfectly. This album sounds like a V8 engine was installed into a synthesizer.
