In 2019 I acquired a substantial amount of new gear some of which I am still waiting on receiving. Thanks to some fantastic deals on Black Friday I now own enough eurorack modules that I have completely filled my first case and have purchased another. I also have upgraded my camera equipment moving to a Canon 5D Mark IV and a Blackmagic Pocket Cinema Camera 6K and professional lighting and sound equipment. Collecting gear is fun but there is always a tendency to focus on near gear or what is the best and keep swapping gear around without ever actually doing anything with equipment purchased. Sure one might enjoy testing out new features and playing around with it for a bit but I want to move pass that focus on using what I have. 

2020 I want to deep dive in the equipment I own. Swapping around hardware is not conductive of mastering how to use the hardware to it's full potential. I've not been doing a lot of swapping but I would like to slow down on getting new things.
