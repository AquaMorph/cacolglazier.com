In 2022 I averaged listening to 53 songs a day for a grand total of 17,672 which is up from my last year total of 16,085. This year I seems to find a nice balance of music while listening to audiobooks and podcasts. Still rarely watching movies and tv shows.

# Favorite Albums of 2022

## 10. Can Opener's Notebook: Fish Whisperer 

{{< spotify "spotify:album:7F81VnxiHp0jDJtQLcsZWo" >}}

I don't know how MLP music is still a thing in 2022 but it is and it's good.

## 9. The Gods We Can Touch 

{{< spotify "spotify:album:5z1xjvymitc0DJETtvVmaX" >}}

An extremely pretty and exceptionally produced art-pop album.

## 8. Chloë and the Next 20th Century

{{< spotify "spotify:album:2tfg6zi5pwuYeQ0IHYnOBz" >}}

Father John Misty and a big band are as it turns out a great combination.

## 7. Bronco

{{< spotify "spotify:album:2hCcPHWTbvF81CiXPUrM6I" >}}

Orville Peck's second album has grown on my a lot of the year. I liked it when it was first released but have enjoyed it more as time has gone on.

## 6. Icons

{{< spotify "spotify:album:5sJJC4UoKTfJaW0jO6YYCG" >}}

Such a fun UK bass album. Playing this album is like unleashing a burst of energy into your day.

## 5. Darklife

{{< spotify "spotify:album:4FLvXR2NkxZDNCLgVJQ1Q8" >}}

death's dynamic shroud are one of the most innovative groups in electronic music who are masters at a wide range of genres and combine them into a new and unique thing that is strictly them.

## 4. River Fools & Mountain Saints 

{{< spotify "spotify:album:6OsF7JfA48kcvWcV4auWIl" >}}

Ian Noe improved on everything from his first album and created one of the best country albums of the year.

## 3. Dawn FM

{{< spotify "spotify:album:2nLOHgzXzwFEpl62zAgCEC" >}}

Another solid complete album from the Weeknd. Over the year this one has grown on my to be my favorite of his but maybe that's just recency bias.

## 2. I know there's something left for you

{{< spotify "spotify:album:2RbaDOyCPPDVwUDnuVY221" >}}

This album is the perfect combination of emo and hyperpop. Although don't judge it from the opening track. 

## 1. God Save The Animals

{{< spotify "spotify:album:6TzgWk5HZItbFmMT7hH4bU" >}}

Alex G perfected the electric and accoustic fusion sound he was going for in this album.
