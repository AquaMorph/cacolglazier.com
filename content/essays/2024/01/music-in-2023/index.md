In 2023 I averaged listening to 41 songs a day for a grand total of 15.231 which is down from my last year total of 17,672. I'm sure if I discovered Zach Bryan sooner it would have been higher.

# Favorite Albums of 2022

## 10. Drink the River

{{< spotify "spotify:album:66w66TUwHavAnh3f0cOQdj" >}}

Solid song writing and one of my favorite folk/country albums of the year.

## 9. Did you know that there's a tunnel under Ocean Blvd

{{< spotify "spotify:album:5HOHne1wzItQlIYmLXLYfZ" >}}

Lana Del Rey has always been one of my favorites but I didn't click with this album initially. Upon listening to it again later it's actually one of her better albums.

## 8. Fountain Baby

{{< spotify "spotify:album:3dKdkVeR6hPjAOH5K2nYTh" >}}

This album is goofy but I really enjoy it well except for the bits about astrology which is just stupid.

## 7. Playing Robots Into Heaven

{{< spotify "spotify:album:2ZwNcWl8h9blysDE8i4juL" >}}

This album feels like the most musical you can make a eurorack system. Some really interesting rhythms.

## 6.  That! Feels Good!

{{< spotify "spotify:album:17g3sAeWfpHSJlqMHuRAr6" >}}

Disco pop is still in and when it is this good I am glad it is. This album has very catchy songs with a lot of dynamics in the mixing which I appreciate.

## 5. 10,000 gecs

{{< spotify "spotify:album:2XS5McKf3zdJWpcZ4OkZPZ" >}}

I am not writing out ten thousand gecs this time. That is too much. I wasn't as big of a fan on first listen to this album as I was with 1,000 gecs but on further listens it's grown on me.

## 4. Again

{{< spotify "spotify:album:2zz6j2mGH5JHk0ihNvy6KM" >}}

This album feels like a return to roots but in a way that is still fresh and exciting.

## 3. The Loveliest Time

{{< spotify "spotify:album:4bRYGKmKOkXvKL1QBf0cGk" >}}

Once again I prefer the B sides to CRJ's A side album.

## 2. I/O

{{< spotify "spotify:album:2Rr46ynx6lOJnkbF2s9VXB" >}}

Releasing two differently mixed versions of the same album is neat. I prefer the bright mix. This album is such a joy to listen to.

## 1. Zach Bryan

{{< spotify "spotify:album:6PbnGueEO6LGodPfvNldYf" >}}

I think the amount of times I listened to this album is a clear indicator of how much I like it. The song writing is up there with any country musician and the music is great too. What more can you ask for?
